Welcome to FocusForge — a zero-friction productivity web app designed for students who want to plan, focus, and thrive without flipping between different tabs and losing their minds
##  Why FocusForge?
Because:
-> You're tired of juggling Google Calendar, Notion, Pomodoro timers, and sticky notes like a circus clown  
-> You deserve an all-in-one dashboard that actually gets you  
-> Your attention span needs a personal trainer (Hello, Focus Mode!)

## core vibes

- Minimalist, distraction-proof design  
- Pomodoro-style timer with smart nudges  
- Sticky notes that actually stick  
- Drag & drop PDFs → get clean summaries instantly  
- Weekly streaks + performance insights to gamify your grind  
- Works offline — because your school/college WiFi can’t be trusted
