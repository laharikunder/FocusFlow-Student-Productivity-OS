Welcome to FocusFlow — a zero-friction productivity web app designed for students who want to plan, focus, and thrive without flipping between different tabs and losing their minds
##  Why FocusFlow?
Because:   
-> You're tired of juggling Google Calendar, Notion, Pomodoro timers, and sticky notes like a circus clown  
-> You deserve an all-in-one dashboard that actually gets you  
-> Your attention span needs a personal trainer (Hello, Focus Mode!)

- Sticky notes that actually stick  
- Drag & drop PDFs → get clean summaries instantly

- Works offline — because your school/college WiFi can’t be trusted
